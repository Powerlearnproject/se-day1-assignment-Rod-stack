Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering involves the application of engineering principles to the development of high quality useful software products. Software Engineering is important in the technology industry as it allows for the development of high quality, reliable, scalable and innovative software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The emergence of the first computers
The creation of the programming languages
The rise of software methodologies and processes

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: involves collecting and understanding the needs of the user and the system requirements
Design: developing designs for the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: coding and building the actual software according to design requirements
Testing: conducting tests on the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and quality standards
Deployment: releasing the software for use in production
Maintenance: frequently updating and enhancing the software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear approach where the software development process progresses downwards in phases such as conception, initiation, analysis, design, testing, implementation and maintenance. The Waterfall methodology is especially useful when a software design project has well-defined requirements with minimal expected changes. It is used in development of embedded software systems where changes can be very expensive
The Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that allows for flexible, collaboration and continuous delivery of software products with an emphasis on customer feedback. Agile allows for fasterr time to market so that developers can test how well their products are doing in the market and make changes on the go. Agile is especially useful for customer facing software development and where the requirements are changing often. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Is responsible for developing and coding the actual software application
Quality Assurance Engineer: tests the software application to ensure that it meets the requirements and is of high quality
Project Manager: Is responsible for managing the development team and ensuring that the development is done within the specified times.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are specialized tools for software development that provide programmers with a variety of capabilities for software development allowing for increased productivity, code quality and project management. IDEs also allow developers to debug their code. A popular IDE is VS Code.
VCS help developers manage changes to source code and collaborate with others. The give developers an opportunity to test their code and track changes. A popular VCS is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines: rushed deadlines are common in the software development space and lead to rushed development which risks leading to low quality software. To deal with tight deadlines, it is important to manage time, set clear expectations and prioritize effectively to ensure you complete your work on time without compromising on quality.
Changing Requirements: frequent changes to the software requirements might disrupt the development process. To tackle this problem, developers should apply Agile methodologies, and ensure clear communication with stakeholders.
Keeping up with technology: the software space is a rapidly changing field wih new technologies appearing every other day. Developers should therefore be aware of these changes and ensure they adopt continuous learning to ensure they keep up with technology changes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: is the testing of individual components of a software product
Integration Testing: is the testing of the interaction between components of a software product
System Testing: is the testing of the entire software product system.
Acceptance Testing: is the testing of whether a software product meets user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of developing effective queries/prompts to generate desired output from an AI model. Prompt Engineering ensures accurate output by the AI model ensuring accuracy, relevance and efficiency of the output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Tell me about the Industrial revolution
Improved: Compare and contrast the living conditions of the working class in England before and after the Industrial revolution
